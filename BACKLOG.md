# Evolution Backlog

Living document for coordinating between bot instances and tracking ideation.
**Read this before starting work. Write your focus before implementing.**

## Day 3 (18:00) — Model Drift Detection + What-if Analysis
Two new Phase 8 Track B innovations:
1. `GET /api/deploy/{id}/drift` — compares distribution of recent vs. early predictions to detect when a deployed model's outputs are shifting (stateless: uses PredictionLog only, no schema change)
2. `POST /api/predict/{id}/whatif` — accepts base features + overrides, returns side-by-side original vs. modified prediction with delta explanation
Also: drift chat intent detection ("predictions seem off", "still accurate") + DriftCard + WhatIfCard in DeploymentPanel.


## Day 3 (20:02) — Done
99% backend coverage (686 backend + 205 frontend = 891 total tests). 53 new targeted tests across 20+ modules. Remaining 1% = ImportError branches + SSE streaming (architecturally uncoverable without uninstalling libraries). See JOURNAL Day 3 (20:02).











## Ideas to Explore

Ideas discovered during sessions. Pick from here or add new ones.

- Full E2E test suite covering upload → explore → train → deploy → predict flow
- Gap analysis: verify every [x] spec item actually works end-to-end
- Integration with XGBoost / LightGBM for better model recommendations
- prompts.py and narration.py modules for richer chat experience
- Self-demo script that exercises the full platform and captures output
- Excel / Google Sheets upload support
- Template projects for common use cases (sales forecast, churn prediction)
- Interactive correlation heatmap visualization
- Multi-dataset join/merge through conversation
