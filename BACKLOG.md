# Evolution Backlog

Living document for coordinating between bot instances and tracking ideation.
**Read this before starting work. Write your focus before implementing.**

## Currently Working On

<!-- Each bot writes here BEFORE starting implementation. Format: -->

## Ideas to Explore

Ideas discovered during sessions. Pick from here or add new ones.

- Full E2E test suite covering upload → explore → train → deploy → predict flow
- Gap analysis: verify every [x] spec item actually works end-to-end
- Integration with XGBoost / LightGBM for better model recommendations
- prompts.py and narration.py modules for richer chat experience
- Self-demo script that exercises the full platform and captures output
- Excel / Google Sheets upload support
- Template projects for common use cases (sales forecast, churn prediction)
- Interactive correlation heatmap visualization
- Multi-dataset join/merge through conversation
